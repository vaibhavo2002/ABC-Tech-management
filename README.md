# ABC Tech - Machine Learning Model Evaluation

## Overview

This project focuses on evaluating multiple machine learning models for classification tasks. The models implemented include Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains structured data for classification. Features are preprocessed, and missing values (if any) are handled appropriately.

## Models Implemented

The following models were trained and evaluated:

- **Logistic Regression**
- **Decision Tree Classifier**
- **Random Forest Classifier**

## Performance Metrics

- **Logistic Regression Accuracy:** 99.95%
- **Decision Tree Accuracy:** 99.92%
- **Random Forest Accuracy:** 99.73%

## Results

Each model is evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The notebook includes visualizations to compare model performances.

## Future Improvements

- Experimenting with hyperparameter tuning
- Exploring advanced models such as XGBoost and Neural Networks
- Deploying the best model as an API
